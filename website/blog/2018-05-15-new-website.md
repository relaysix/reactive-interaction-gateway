RIG version 1.0 was basically a working prototype, but with version 2.0 approaching, we're thinking a lot about ways of improving the user experience and getting the community aboard.

Right now, RIG may not be the most inviting product on earth, so let's change that! In the following weeks, we're going to put a strong focus on improving the user experience:

- We'll be working on the documentation, so that it'll be easier and more obvious what RIG can do, and how to get started using it.
- To lower the learning curve, we're planning a "development mode" with sane defaults for running RIG on your laptop. Since writing a login service shouldn't be your highest priority when starting a project, JWT validation will be made optional. Also, a new subscription mechanism will enable clients to create subscriptions without any tokens at all---more on that in a later blog post! Speaking of blog posts..
- Blog posts! We realize that communication is key to building a community around RIG. We start off by writing blog posts on a regular basis (hopefully), but there are also other ideas, like video tutorials.

Stay tuned!
